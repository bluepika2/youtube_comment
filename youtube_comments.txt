why do they try to make it acomedy with naive scenese, humor thats not funny, erc etc.  its just dumb.  make it more serious.   hopefully part 2 is.
this is marketing. the trailer shows the motorcycle scene to make us believe that it’ll be the climax of the film, and almost completely ignoring the actual climax with the train. studios(and even paramount themselves) have to take notes.
mission impossible is what michael scott&#39;s fantasy coming true looks like<br><br>agreerers hit like 👍
all tom had to do was to break one key in two parts and throw it in different places.
more of a guy that looks vaguely like tom cruise after three or four facelifts running around looking very serious and then looking into the camera with a very serious expression on his face (one of two in his actor’s toolbox )  and then, well, more running around looking very serious (let me guess: he’s trying to save the world so that we can all become wacko scientologists?). and this is only part one!!! egad. what could part two possibly bring that we haven’t seen before? a new airplane perhaps?
cotton =kapas extra thinking
dead reckoning had an even bigger cast, and everyone did a fantastic job. i especially loved hayley atwell; she did a great job in this one. she plays an excellent and charming thief stunning cinematography, unbelievable stunts, gripping suspense-filled storyline and just top notch superb brilliant acting that takes you on a fantastic rollercoaster of emotions.
equipped with tom cruise’s legs and flapping arms, mission impossible dead reckoning part one runs through a roller coaster course to add yet another stunning and adrenaline inducing film to the 3-decade old franchise.<br><br>60 years old… let it sink in for bit. with the way tom cruise is performing i can see him and his iconic running for another century or so. but really, on a serious note, it is just simply impressive the way he has become and still is the embodiment of a “blockbuster”. we find the star actor synergizing once again with director christoper mcquarrie, and reprising roles of equally amazing supporting cast: rebecca ferguson, simon pegg, ving rhames, vanessa kirby, the newly addition and ravishing hayley atwell, not to mention esai morales as the villain. mission impossible has seen another opportunity to utilize ethan hunt (tom cruise) on a quest to neutralize, or i must say, destroy an ai threatening world domination. dead reckoning part one is nothing short of stunts, gritty action sequences, and breathtaking chase scenes. a job well done for the direction and the entire team. overall, the film has successfully established a solid foundation for the dead reckoning part 2.
watching it confidence after the tatto. what if he kills the right ones?
the story is …. stupid.    how can so much money be based on such a weak story.

this is really dumb move all you need to know os the location of the submarine 😅 so why do all the drama , i bet they are planning on putting gabriel in the submarine and he would be saying stuff like , you might have the keys but the gates opens only for me😂
what a rubbish job im doing tom get people overboard and keep them sexually motivated ironies of living
glad to say kitty litteredge is back

this is probably one of the worst from the series. the main actors are old geriatrics in their 60s and 50s so they&#39;re not believable as they&#39;re bing cast in such action roles

i watch this movie and i also watch death reckoning part 2
who&#39;s here after watching the teaser trailer of mission impossible the final reckoning?<br><br>👇
i cannot emphasise enough how fabulous of an actor rebecca ferguson is. <br>how disappointing that she was replaced with a younger version as usual in movie sequels.<br>disgusting. <br>shame on you tom cruise
who is here after final reckoning trailer?
i’m telling you this trailer is 100 times better than “mi:8 the final reckoning” and they should’ve not been scared of having “part 2” in the title, the vibe of tfr feels like a part 2 anyways. what a shame!
this was the single most disappointing movie i had ever seen. the trailer had raised the bar so much for me but then the movie instantly dropped. watch mission impossible 2, way better than this. best mission impossible movie till date.
final reckoning may 2025 yes sir
who&#39;s here after the final reckoning trailer?
after its sequel abandoned its original subtitle, dead reckoning part two, the film was retitled mission: impossible – dead reckoning when it was released on streaming platforms.

love the motorcycle  - had a honda  cb350 with a similar frame. never got it to run, but i miss it.<br>can&#39;t wait for the second reveal in the next movie installment. <br>so glad that when joel goodsen went to princeton university - he change his major from business to a dual {political science &amp; computer science.} lol
final scene is uncharted 2 game
imagine nolan and tom cruise in the same movie? that has my ticket already...
2025 will be “the year of michael joe jackson!!!” mj will make his-story like no other!!! mj loves to do the impossible!!! and pulling off the greatest death hoax in history is pretty impossible!!! but not for mj!!! “see you in july!!!” 777 is on his armband=&gt; 7-7-25!!! bam!!!<br>777
i wonder why we still don&#39;t have a trailer of mission impossible 8 yet and when this 1st trailer is gonna be released since the movie is supposed to come out in 7 months already.<br>i heard rumors there&#39;s gonna be one in november for gladiator 2
watch nothing with that little man in it. worthless bag of skin.
tom cruise is an amazing actor!! i love watching mission impossible dead reckoning part one. i am so excited for the next one!!!! who else is excited for the next mission impossible movie?

my last comment is, really disappointed in you, as i believe you are in a position to help and staying away is just behaving of an coward.  i won&#39;t hold it against you but want you to know that is where my thought is and it really shouldn&#39;t be !!!! time for your network to man up and start acting with integrity like me
fyi - i am not anything like the scum bag in flat 2
well i forgive you as i actually like you
is that why we have a delay with part 2 !!!
jay, please don&#39;t worry about me
need advice guys, many people hated the movie. many said it has big plot holes, the fighting sequences are terrible and the ai??? thing is stupid. they also said that benji and luthor acted badly? i havent watched it. ive enjoyed all of the previous ones tho. is this worth watching? tom is also old too, its weird watching a 60 year old being the &quot;unstoppable agent&quot;. so worth watching or not?

i have only seen one of these.   2 or 3 back 20 years ago. i was so bored i almost fell asleep.  would have to pay me to watch another.
i am desperate now for part two. this movie is not just amazing. it is profound. 30 years ago this story was science fiction, but now it’s not so far removed from reality.
elsa dies not gonna watch
pick us both out
dont use nuke pls
they had a half key to begin with.. if they had destroyed it.. then no one would ever get the whole key.. problem solved.. idiotic movie 😅
tom cruise made 🎉 as vin diesel fast x and reflect whats happen now wirhout be silly or ..❤
i tell you my dear friend pol my blood is sickness !
endless nonsensical stunts in venice that make it an action style da vinci code #3 and the obligatory mysterious albino assassin.<br>female actresses who are so bad they look like replicants with the wide eye glazed stare, frozen face expression etc.<br>tom cruise obligatory running, running, running... and some jumping.<br>and dark mystical conversations with nods and evil grins, which are supposed to lay out the plot but actually tell you nothing. <br>oh and at least 3 pretty females available for tom.
tom cruise special trademark : run for life.....😂❤❤
misson impossible vs thalapathy is the goat
this movie took a lot from the uncharted game series . the whole train sequence was taken from uncharted for sure . i don’t know anyone else noticed that too .
thalapathy tu tu tu tu 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
i’m ready for part 2.
มอไซด์ทิ้งหน้าผา

excellent action movie ever. but market strategy was bad to released just one week before barbie and oppenheimer.
another stupid hollywood movie pushing the agenda that casts women hero and villain.
truth is vanished, war is coming 😇
the world is changing... truth is vanishing... war is coming!!       ...sounds like a signal to me.
this is one of the coolest trailers for a movie i’ve ever seen, so epic
this movie is still my favorite of 2023 and also the best mi for me. the movie has a bold move on it&#39;s character, i loves how they made our heroes lose and they still not giving up on the mission. the entity is suit for being an impossible mission.
期待mi8
this movie is so true.   the ai nwo will get worse.   swell robots and ai everywhere.   stealing your life, your information, furthering ai jobloss.   solution, cease ai.
worst mi movie because nothing make any sense and it&#39;s boring.
tom cruise ❤❤
so.....who is blowing the train whistle ......
tbh, the acting and the fighting scenes are terrible!
beautiful film&#39;s tom crous ❤❤

mission impossible 9 on get nithyafied..⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕⭕
i think everyone love ethan hunt more than james bond.
this is an amazing film overall. the whole plot, the action, just everything. so well acted overall and exciting. and tom cruise has aged so well. he looks stunning in this 😍 💖
the movie is 1 year old!!!<br><br>this movie acts as a timely rumination on the dangers of ai; it shouldn’t come as a surprise since modern technology could potentially replace human beings making more calculating decisions to make the world more stable<br>in this case calculating the position of a moving object<br>definitely one of the franchises best installments!<br>long but intriguing given an uneasy feeling of this tech evolving, learning, and exploiting a human’s weakness<br>this makes ethan and his team rely more on paranoia than their training and instincts <br>tom cruise still has it, love they brought back supporting players from older films like vanessa kirby and rebecca ferguson<br>i really liked hayley atwell a lot, she has so much charm unsure what to make of her situation going her own way but staying alive in the process<br>action and stunts still deliver too pushing them even further and higher<br>i’m glad this cliffhanger didn&#39;t end on a too somber note, really wondering now how they will wrap up everything with part 2<br>much needed humor adds to the variety of the various stuff the characters get into<br>you’re either on board with the set up or just finding it far too silly being full of plot holes<br>maybe too much exposition and some empty dialogue with weak villains but fun and definitely worth the wait<br>cruise and company still bring all the intensity in a saga that manages to not overstay its welcome
tom cruise took the spy character ethan hunt on another level. sometimes i think he is better than james bond.
how and why is mission impossible still using those silly rubber face mask?  a person body type is just as noticeable as a face. was annoyed by it after the very 1st mi. yet they have used the rubber mask in at least every mi since and multiple times in same movie. so overused it that every scene can be questioned and can say after every scene, why didn’t they use. lol. cruise hanging onto a flying plane by 1 hand is more realistic than those mask. least limit the use, it’s flat out beat to death.
i need to buy this movie it seems like i&#39;m missing out lots of action.
top cruise actually did the right thing - i like what he did with the movie direction and the stunts - respect tom!
i wonder why people hate sir tom...cause nobody can do it better love from india(nagaland..we ve akshay and sharukh here earning by dancing...😅
not sure tom cruise is 61 or 30. im 29 and i look like his father
watched first part and waiting for second ❤
duty - me. now! 🇸🇬
tom sir enjoy your win happy birthday dear sir.
how did it manage to be obsolete? it fell so much in quality that it ended up on the same shelf as agent stone 👎
the train runs on steam from burning coal, without someone keeps adding it the train eventually slows down. you should&#39;ve pick the diesel one ,mission plausible.
best movie’s trailer ❤❤❤

mission impossible 7 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; barbenheimer
easily the dumbest and worst one in the series. something horrible changed in the producers/directors.
i don’t care what people say about tim cruise in his personal life but put respect to his name.
i’ll never understand why they decided to go with older guys trying to track ethan down instead of younger ones. shea is way too out of shape to be trying to run after someone as fit as tom.
i feel 😢:sorry that this movie flopped and i also feel 😢:sorry for the character ethan for what he has to go through in this movie 🎥.
part 2 when😢😢
some bad cgi, everyone saying ethan! grace!  and lots of picking pockets.  that’s about it.
what a superb movie...❤❤..well done guys..love a<br>nd congrats from india...tom cruise love u brother

a must see to all who is into the tech of today.  a.i is going to become the worlds enemy.  when it turns on us this movie is the perfect example of what it will do to us.  tom cruise is incredible.  the whole cast is great.   haley is smoking hot.  and iisla is sexy as they come.  great movie a must watch.
what a movie
when  does indian cinema  get these type of movies get done in there own backyard , all they do is copy from english movies and  make crap copy of it
a few well-executed but predictable action pieces and almost shockingly bad dialogue makes for a cliché of a film with not a single new idea.

one thing about tom cruise, like him or hate him, he took a series and literally ran with it. mission: impossible is still relevant.
should have just killed the new girl. i like ilsa faust way more than her.
although tom&#39;s a phenomenal actor ever since mcquaire took over he&#39;s really been bringing out great acting from tom.
esse cara é demais  tom cruiser  muito bom filme  top
this trailer spoiled all thegood scenes. thats y i avoid trailer
they really need to stop showing every single action scene in the trailer. 150 years of film making and hollywood still doesn&#39;t understand the main ingredient for success: element of surprise!<br><br>great film nonetheless. but spoiled by the trailer.

mission: impossible is a beautiful film, and the graphics are super interesting
&quot;mission: impossible - dead reckoning&quot; could be considered as part of an action and espionage film series. the film may revolve around the adventures of the character ethan hunt, portrayed by tom cruise, in dangerous missions. as with other films in the series, high-paced action scenes, mysterious intrigues, and international espionage themes are expected.
perfect
maraqlıdir 👍👍
